<!--
Thank you so much for your PR!  To help us review your contribution, please
consider the following points:

- A development guide is available at https://geocat.ucar.edu/pages/contributing.html.

- Fork this repository and open the PR from your fork. Do not directly work on
  the NCAR/geocat-comp repository.

- The PR title should summarize the changes, for example "Create weighted pearson-r
  correlation coefficient function". Avoid non-descriptive titles such as "Addresses
  issue #229".

- The summary should provide at least 1-2 sentences describing the pull request
  in detail (Why is this change required?  What problem does it solve?) and
  link to any relevant issues.

If you need assistance with your PR, please let the GeoCAT team know by
tagging us with @geocat. We can help if reviews are unclear, the recommended changes
seem overly demanding, you would like help in addressing a reviewer's comments,
or if you have been waiting more than a week to hear back on your PR.
