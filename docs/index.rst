GeoCAT-comp
===========

GeoCAT-comp is computational component of the `GeoCAT <https://geocat.ucar.edu/>`_
project. GeoCAT-comp provides implementations of computational functions for operating
on geosciences data. Many of these functions originated in NCL and were translated into
Python with the help of GeoCAT-comp; however, developers are welcome to come up with
novel computational functions for geosciences data.
