Introduction
------------

Thank you for considering contributing to `geocat-comp`! There are many ways to
contribute to this project, including reporting bugs, requesting additional or
new functionality, improving our documentation, or contributing your own code
and we appreciate all of them.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us on `GitHub
Discussions <https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-comp/discussions>`__ You can also
reach us by email at geocat@ucar.edu.

Where to start
--------------

Look through our open issues and see if there is anything you would like to take
on! We recomment working with core developers to implement new functionality. We
can help you get started and make sure your code is consistent with the rest of
the project.

Also check out any beginner-friendly issues we have tagged with `good first
issue <https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-comp/labels/good%20first%20issue>`__.

We do not officially "assign" issues to contributors, but if you are interested
in working on an issue, please comment on the issue to let us know you are
working on it. This will help us avoid duplicate work.


Bug reports and feature requests
--------------------------------

We have issue templates for both `bug reports
<https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-comp/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%2C+support&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=>`__
and `feature requests
<https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-comp/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=>`__.

When reporting a bug, please include as much information as possible. This will
help us reproduce the bug and fix it efficiently. For more
information on how to write a good bug report, see this stackoverflow post on
`how to make a good bug report
