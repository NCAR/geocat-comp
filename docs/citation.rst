How to cite GeoCAT-comp
-----------------------

If you use this software, we would appreciate a citation!

Each GeoCAT-comp version is assigned a separate Digital Object Identifier (DOI) to allow
users to access older releases. This ensures that users are not only able to cite the specific
software version through DOIs but are also able to download & use the corresponding release for
reproducibility purposes.

Please find DOIs for all the GeoCAT-comp versions `here
<https://zenodo.org/search?page=1&size=20&q=conceptrecid:%226607205%22&sort=-version&all_versions=True>`__.

If you would like to cite GeoCAT-comp as a whole (without referring to a specific version), use
the following text:

    **Visualization & Analysis Systems Technologies. (2019).
    Geoscience Community Analysis Toolkit: GeoCAT-comp [Software].
    Boulder, CO: UCAR/NCAR - Computational and Informational System Lab. doi:10.5281/zenodo.6607205.**

Instead, if you would like to cite a specific version of GeoCAT-comp, use the following text:

    **Visualization & Analysis Systems Technologies. (\<Year\>).
    Geoscience Community Analysis Toolkit: GeoCAT-comp (v\<version\>) [Software].
    Boulder, CO, USA: UCAR/NCAR - Computational and Informational System Lab. doi:\<DOI\>.**

In the above citation text, update the year, GeoCAT-comp version, and DOI as appropriate. For
example:

    **Visualization & Analysis Systems Technologies. (2022).
    Geoscience Community Analysis Toolkit: GeoCAT-comp (v2022.04.0) [Software].
    Boulder, CO, USA: UCAR/NCAR - Computational and Informational System Lab. doi:10.5281/zenodo.6607349.**

Please note: The DOI minting service, Zenodo, might be suggesting their own citation text (as
they are the publisher of such DOIs) in their website. We prefer the text we recommend here to be used;
however, either way is acceptable.
