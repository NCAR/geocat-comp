GeoCAT-comp is both the whole computational component of the [GeoCAT](https://geocat.ucar.edu/)
project and a single Github repository as described here. As the computational component of
[GeoCAT](https://geocat.ucar.edu/), GeoCAT-comp provides implementations of computational functions for operating
on geosciences data. Many of these functions originated in NCL and were translated into Python with the help of GeoCAT-comp;
however, developers are welcome to come up with novel computational functions for geosciences data.

Many of the computational functions in GeoCAT are implemented in a pure Python fashion. However,
there are some others that are implemented in Fortran but wrapped up in Python. To facilitate
contribution, the whole GeoCAT-comp structure is split into two repositories with respect to
being pure-Python or Python with compiled codes (i.e. Fortran) implementations. Such implementation
layers are handled within [GeoCAT-comp](https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-comp) and
[GeoCAT-f2py](https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-f2py) repositories, respectively (The
[GeoCAT-f2py](https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-f2py) repo is documented on its own).


# GeoCAT-comp

GeoCAT-comp repo does not explicitly contain or require any compiled code, making it more
accessible to the general Python community at large. However, if
[GeoCAT-f2py](https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-f2py) is installed, then all functions contained in
the "geocat.f2py" package are imported seamlessly into the "geocat.comp" namespace. Thus,
GeoCAT-comp repo serves as a user API to access the entire computational toolkit even though the
repo itself only contains pure Python code from the contributorâ€™s perspective. Whenever prospective
contributors want to add new computational functionality implemented as pure Python, GeoCAT-comp
is the repo to do so. Therefore, there is no onus on contributors of pure python code to
build/compile/test any compiled code (i.e. Fortran) at GeoCAT-comp level.

# Installation and build instructions

Please see our documentation for
[installation and build instructions](https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-comp/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md).


# Xarray interface vs NumPy interface

GeoCAT-comp provides a high-level [Xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) interface under the
`geocat.comp` namespace. However, a stripped-down NumPy interface is used under the hood to bridge
the gap between NumPy arrays and the compiled language data structures used by
[GeoCAT-f2py](https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-f2py). These functions are accessible under the
`geocat.comp` namespace, but are minimally documented and are
intended primarily for internal use.
